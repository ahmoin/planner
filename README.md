# Academic Planner

A personalized assignment scheduler designed to help students manage their
academic workload effectively by tracking assignments, grades, and study
progress in one intuitive interface.

## About the Project

### Inspiration

As a student, I often found myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of
assignments, projects, and exams across different courses. Traditional planners
and calendar apps didn't account for the complexity of academic lifeâ€”varying
assignment weights, different grading systems, and the need for strategic study
planning. This project was born from my personal struggle to find a tool that
could help students like me stay on top of their academic responsibilities while
maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

### What I Learned

Building this academic planner has been an incredible learning journey:

- **Full-Stack Development**: Gained hands-on experience with modern web
  technologies including Next.js, React, and Convex for backend services
- **Data Visualization**: Implemented interactive charts using Recharts to
  provide students with clear insights into their academic performance
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application works seamlessly across
  different devices and screen sizes
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged TypeScript to catch errors early and improve code
  quality

### Technical Implementation

The application is built with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19 and TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for the foundation of the design system
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for interactive and accessible charts
- **Backend**: Convex for database and serverless functions
- **Authentication**: Database and auth provided by Convex
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and continuous deployment

Key features include:

- Assignment tracking with due dates and statuses
- Grade calculation and GPA tracking
- Interactive performance analytics
- Responsive design for all devices
- Secure user accounts with data persistence

### Future Enhancements

- Mobile app development for on-the-go access
- Integration with popular learning management systems (LMS)
- AI-powered study recommendations
- Collaborative features for group projects
- Advanced analytics and predictive performance tracking
